			<description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology, not the other way around. ~ Steve Jobs
Last weekend I had the opportunity to participate in Problems Worth Solving: Texas A&amp;amp;M&amp;rsquo;s first and only entrepreneurship competition that outright bans solutions.
Great businesses arise from an intimate understanding of your customers&amp;rsquo; needs. PWS emphasizes this critical step of entrepreneurship by focusing entrepreneurs on the problem, not the solution.</description>

<p>Last weekend I had the opportunity to participate in <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/student-life/eep/problems-worth-solving-competition.html">Problems Worth Solving</a>:
Texas A&amp;M&rsquo;s first and only entrepreneurship competition that outright <em>bans</em> solutions.</p>
<p>Great businesses arise from an intimate understanding of your customers&rsquo; needs.
PWS emphasizes this critical step of entrepreneurship by focusing entrepreneurs on the problem, <strong>not</strong> the solution.
The competition was 5 minutes of presenting in-depth on an important problem that many face, and 5 minutes of Q&amp;A with industry judges.</p>
<p>I chose to present on EV battery recycling. Current legislation aims to get more people into Electric Vehicles for the good of the climate and the environment.
But our current solutions to recycle EV batteries are inefficient, expensive, and environmentally detrimental.
I emphasized the need solutions for battery supply chains, recycling processes, and repairability that are cost-effective and scalable.</p>
<p>The whole experience was great! I ended up getting second place with this presentation.

			<title>A sane mini-tutorial for the Jenkins Javascript API</title>

			<description>Holy moly, the Jenkins documentation is bad. At the very least, it isn&amp;rsquo;t very user-friendly, especially for beginners. For someone who has little-to-no experience in web development, doing something as simple as getting some job data from a Node program is the equivalent of pulling teeth. After spending hours in rabbit holes, I finally stumbled on a configuration that works. This mini-writeup will hopefully help those webdev-challenged folks such as myself in the quest for Jenkins API usage.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Holy moly, the Jenkins documentation is bad. At the very least, it isn&rsquo;t very user-friendly, especially for beginners.
For someone who has little-to-no experience in web development, doing something as simple as getting some job data from a Node program is the equivalent of pulling teeth. After spending hours in rabbit holes, I finally stumbled on a configuration that works. This mini-writeup will hopefully help those webdev-challenged folks such as myself in the quest for Jenkins API usage.</p>
<p>My goal for this project was pulling real-time job data from Jenkins, so I won&rsquo;t dive into more advanced stuff like creating jobs and triggering builds. But the Jenkins API does support those actions, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="api-points-of-interest">API Points of Interest</h2>
<p>The Jenkins API is REST-like: information about what data you want to fetch is encoded directly into the url the fetch request is sent to. Since Jenkins doesn&rsquo;t have a list of which URLs actually contain useful data, I&rsquo;ve <del>copied</del> <strong>compiled and expanded upon</strong> <a href="https://gist.github.com/justlaputa/5634984">justlaputa&rsquo;s Github gist</a> of useful api URLs.</p>
<p><em>Note</em> that <code>jenkins_url</code> is the link to your Jenkins controller instance: it may need to include a port number as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>List all jobs on Jenkins: <code>jenkins_url</code>+<code>/api/json?tree=jobs[name,color]</code></li>
<li>List all builds for a job named <code>${job_name}</code>: <code>jenkins_url</code>+<code>/job/${job_name}/lastBuild/api/json?tree=builds[number,status,timestamp,id,result]</code></li>
<li>List last build info for a job named <code>${job_name}</code>: <code>jenkins_url</code>+<code>/job/${job_name}/lastBuild/api/json</code></li>
<li>List build progress for a job named <code>${job_name}</code>: <code>jenkins_url</code>+<code>/job/${job_name}/lastBuild/api/json?tree=result,timestamp,estimatedDuration</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>The Jenkins API states that it uses BASIC authentication to allow API access. There are exactly 0 examples about using BASIC authentication in the API, so I&rsquo;ve taken it upon myself to provide some sample code.</p>
<h3 id="the-api-token">The API Token</h3>
<p>To access Jenkins from an API, you&rsquo;ll have to generate an API token. To do so, click the <em>Configure</em> button under the username in the top right corner.
<figure class="big"><img src="TokenGen1.png"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>Configure option under username</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

Then click <em>Add new Token</em> under the <em>API Token</em> heading.
<figure class="big"><img src="TokenGen2.png"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>Add token Button</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>This will generate a new token, which looks like a string of random text. Copy it somewhere safe, because you won&rsquo;t be able to see it again!</p>
<h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a Javascript programmer, so I can&rsquo;t go in-depth and explain how this authentication works. But I <em>can</em> tell you that this code does work.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>let JENKINS_URL = &#34;localhost:8080&#34; // replace with url of your Jenkins server
let JENKINS_UNAME = &#34;Jenkins-User&#34; // replace with username you generated token for
let JENKINS_JOB = &#34;BuildWebsite&#34;   // replace with name of job you want to pull data from
let API_TOKEN   = &#34;gobbedygook000000letters00000and0000numbers&#34; // replace with API token you generated above

function JobData(jobName){
    // fill this string with the information found in API Points of Interest
    // here, I pull information on the most recently run job.
	const url = `http://${JENKINS_URL}/job/${jobName}/lastBuild/api/json?pretty=true`

	return fetch ( url, {
        // authorization for fetch request
		method: &#34;GET&#34;,
		headers:{
			Authorization :
			&#34;Basic &#34; + 
			Buffer.from(`${JENKINS_UNAME}:${API_TOKEN}`).toString(&#34;base64&#34;)
		},

	}).then((res, req) =&gt; {
		return res.json()
        //this function returns the job information.
	})
}
</code></pre><h2 id="cross-site-request-forgery">Cross Site Request Forgery</h2>
<p>It is important to note that while Javascript can be run from both the frontend or the backend, API calls must be made from a backend to prevent <em>Cross-Site Request Forgeries.</em> So, there&rsquo;s really no way to make API calls from <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags embedded in an HTML file. You&rsquo;ll need to make a backend that serves the Jenkins data to the frontend, and host it on the internet (with something like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>) or locally (with <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/walkthroughs/deploy/nodejs/">Passenger</a> or something similar).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it. This is a super short article, but something like this would have saved me about 10 hours of googling. Hopefully this will help some of you aspiring Jenkins-wranglers learn something new!</p>

			<description>Post-Mod GE-7
The Mod If you just want to skip to the fix, head to this section.
At the advice of Brian Wampler, I caved and bought a minty used Boss GE-7. Imagine my surprise after moving any of the EQ sliders introduced very noticeable noise! How could you, Boss? Apparently, when the GE-7 was first designed, battery life and price point were more important considerations than audio fidelity. As a result, any GE-7s made from 1981 to 2017 use the TL022 dual op-amp chips.</description>

<p>If you just want to skip to the fix, head to <a href="#the-fix">this section</a>.</p>
<p>At the advice of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hypn6uA6RPs">Brian Wampler</a>, I caved and bought a minty used Boss GE-7.
Imagine my surprise after moving any of the EQ sliders introduced very noticeable noise! How could you, Boss? Apparently, when the GE-7 was first designed, battery life and price point were more important considerations than audio fidelity.
As a result, any GE-7s made from 1981 to 2017 use the <code>TL022</code> dual op-amp chips. These outdated chips are surpassed in every aspect of audio performance by the more recent <code>NE5532</code> dual op-amps, despite drawing more current.
<em>(<a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ne5532.pdf">38 mA</a> vs <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl022.pdf?ts=1672127917081">6 mA</a> in output short-circuit condition. <a href="https://www.physics.unlv.edu/~bill/PHYS483/op_amp_datasheet.pdf">This is a good read</a> if you need a refresher on op-amp datasheet deciphering)</em>.</p>
<p>Boss also used cheapo-ceramic capacitors in the signal path of the GE-7. Ceramics can be microphonic due to the piezoelectric effect: this is possibly the worst type of non-ideality an audio component can have. Subsitituting these for film capacitors would drastically improve audio fidelity. Since my pedal was an older model, I decided to replace all of the electrolytic capacitors as well. These caps have most likely dried out after 40+ years of use.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not in the mood to source parts for myself in the middle of a rabid chip market (Even through-hole parts are getting hard to find!), I opted for the <a href="https://fromelelectronics.com/products/ge7-mods">Fromel mod kit</a>.</p>
<p>This pedal was made back when manufacturers cared about repairability, and it shows. The GE-7 was very easy to disassemble. After socketing and soldering the new op-amps, I tried to fire the pedal up. There was no sound.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<p>The broken pedal behaved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the switch was held down, the clean (bypass) signal could be heard clearly</li>
<li>If the switch wasn&rsquo;t held down, an extremely loud buzzing could be heard</li>
<li>The wet (equalized) signal could not be heard, regardless of switch position</li>
<li>The LED never turned on</li>
</ul>
<figure class="left"><img src="inside1.jpg"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>GE-7 Gutshot</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The buzzing noise sounded a bit like a ground loop, which is often caused by grounding issues. Using a continuity checker, I discovered that the switch ground wasn&rsquo;t connected to the power jack&rsquo;s ground. But the pedal worked before I took it apart: what could have changed??</p>
<h1 id="the-fix">The Fix</h1>
<p>Taking a closer look at the switch grounding revealed all! See how the switch&rsquo;s ground (black wire) is attached to the output jack, and nothing else? The switch will only be grounded if output jack is attached to the enclosure. The enclosure itself needs to be grounded as well: The ground output from the 9v input connection to the input jack handles this. All this means that the pedal will only switch properly if the input and output jacks are electrically connected to (or screwed into) the enclosure! After alligator-clipping the switch ground and power jack ground together, and plugging my guitar in, it worked like a charm!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been having this issue, check 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a continuity checker (most multimeters should have one) to see if all of the grounds are connected</li>
<li>Make sure a 1/4&quot; cable is plugged into the pedal&rsquo;s <em>input</em> jack. If nothing is plugged in, the pedal won&rsquo;t activate.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h1>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve been told to <a href="https://www.coda-effects.com/2017/07/ground-loops-and-guitar-pedals.html">always ground the enclosure</a>, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen an entire pedal&rsquo;s functionality rely on this rule of thumb. Doing so saves exactly two, but those are two wires to potentially break, and two wires to pay for.
But there&rsquo;s a pretty cool reason behind all of this.
In 1981, Boss couldn&rsquo;t rest on the laurels of being a legendary effects manufacturer: it had to build a reputation, which it did by offering invincible pedals at an unbeatable price point.
Even using the enclosure as a ground plane speaks to the dual priorities of build quality and cost that continue to make Boss pedals so ubiquitous, even today.</p>

			<description>Faced with the tradition of family Christmas gift giving, I was thoroughly stumped. I knew I wanted to do something maker-related: I&amp;rsquo;m the only engineer in the family, which tends to amplify the wow factor of any techncal projects :)
After my fallback plan (a Chemex coffee maker) fell through, I knew I had to build these!
the finished product!
These are long-distance friendship lanterns. The idea is, sometimes you want to let a distant friend or family member know that you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of them, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to shoot them a text.</description>

I knew I wanted to do something maker-related: I&rsquo;m the only engineer in the family, which tends to amplify the wow factor of any techncal projects :)</p>

<p>These are <a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Long-Distance-Best-Friend-Lights/">long-distance friendship lanterns</a>. The idea is, sometimes you want to let a distant friend or family member know that you&rsquo;re thinking of them, even if you don&rsquo;t necessarily want to shoot them a text. The lanterns couldn&rsquo;t be simpler to use: turning on your lantern also turns on your friends&rsquo; lantern, no matter where they are in the world.</p>
<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>
<p>This project has multiple boxes (one for each family member), all of which can send &ldquo;thinking of you&rdquo; messages to each other. For example, if I&rsquo;m currently thinking about my dad, I can make his box light up from my box! But how does he know it&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s thinking of him, and not someone else? To solve this, each box is assigned a color, which is associated with the box owner. So when I send a message to my dad, his box will become my color. To send a message, I can press the push button, which cycles through all the possible colors to send to. Not pressing the button for 2 seconds will send the message, lighting up the senders&rsquo; and receivers&rsquo; box for 2 hours. Confusing? I made a diagram.</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<h3 id="mqtt">MQTT</h3>
<p>I knew that <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> would be a great fit for this project: it even bills itself as &ldquo;The standard for IoT messaging&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s lightweight, bidirectional, and requires minimal infrastructure.  Without getting too into the weeds, every message, or <strong>post</strong>, is published to a <strong>topic</strong>. Once a message is published to a topic, all other devices subscribed to the same topic receive the new message. By making a topic for each box, (i.e. the <em>green</em> box will receive any posts sent to the <em>green</em> topic), anyone&rsquo;s post to that box&rsquo;s topic will be interpreted as a message to turn that box on.</p>
<p>Of course, this system still requires a central server, called a broker, to make sure messages get to where they&rsquo;re sent. Luckily, <a href="https://console.hivemq.cloud/">HiveMQ</a> is one such server with a generous free tier that this project&rsquo;s constraints fall well within. It also <em>HAD</em> a <a href="https://console.hivemq.cloud/clients/arduino-esp8266?uuid=c689cd9ab0cf406bbc142988277304d9">super neat tutorial</a> for getting started on an Arduino, but the page seems to be broken. Either way, my implementation is based on their sample publish-receive code.</p>
<h3 id="arduino">Arduino</h3>
<p>Everyone and their mother knows that Arduino is the way to go for simple MCU programming. Abundant libraries handle all of the hard stuff, all you have to do is bring the logic. Besides some Linux issues (Manjaro didn&rsquo;t seem to like my UDEV rules, solution <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All/#Permission">here</a>), everything was simple to set up.</p>
<p>As for libraries, I utilized <a href="https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/wiki/Basic-usage">FastLED</a> to program simple light animations in the Neopixel strip. ESP8266WiFi is obviously needed to connect the device to the network, and other boilerplate libraries such as <a href="">PubSubClient</a> and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/littlefs_esp32/">LittleFS</a> were used to authenticate with the HiveMQ server.</p>

<p>I am blessed to live within driving distance of Micro Center, a legendary PC superstore with a sizeable DIY/maker section.
I knew I needed an Arduino board with wifi support, and Micro Center had the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821">Adafruit Feather Huzzah</a> in stock.
This board&rsquo;s specs are overkill for this application, but it definitely does the job.
Also from the Micro Center haul was a strip of NeoPixels, and some push-button switches for control.
Add in a clear case from the container store, and we&rsquo;re ready to rock!</p>

</div>

<p>In short, yeah! The only issues I&rsquo;ve run into are logging related. When I rolled these boxes out, I didn&rsquo;t include any method of logging messages. This makes it very difficult to troubleshoot the boxes, since I simply don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening at any given time. Throw in the fact that I have no method of remotely updating the boxes, even small logic bugs are difficult to fix. But after being rolled out for 3 months, all the reported issues can be fixed just by power cycling the device, so I&rsquo;d call this a win! If you find any issues with my programming, don&rsquo;t hesitate to hit me with a pull request!</p>

			<title>Spelling Test Grader [UPDATE]</title>
			<link>https://ethan-cope.github.io/posts/auto-grader-update/</link>

			<description>One in six children who are not reading proficiently in third grade fail to graduate from high school on time, four times the rate for children with proficient third-grade reading skills. &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;Double Jeopardy&amp;quot;, Annie E. Casey Foundation
Since rolling out my spelling test grader, Catch Up and Read (CAR) has asked for more grading automation! Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick update on the new grader, the Phonics Survey.

</blockquote>
<p>Since rolling out my spelling test grader, Catch Up and Read (CAR) has asked for more grading automation!
Here&rsquo;s a quick update on the new grader, the <em>Phonics Survey</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-phonics-survey">What is a Phonics Survey?</h2>
<p>Throughout the span of the CAR program, students need to be benchmarked. The phonics survey determines which consonant-vowel blend types a student struggles with. By asking students to read words aloud, teachers mark down which words they struggle with, and tally up the number of incorrect words per section. They then use this data to plan their lessons around words that students have trouble with.</p>
<figure class="middle"><img src="PhonicsSurveyExample.png"
         alt="phonics survey example section"/><figcaption>
            <p>phonics survey example section</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Phonics surveys were historically administered through paper tests: a teacher would manually tally incorrect words, identify problem sections, and enter student information into a spreadsheet. Phonics surveys aren&rsquo;t particularly labor-intensive, but as CAR began supporting more schools, it became obvious that this solution wouldn&rsquo;t scale. Hence, automation!</p>
<h2 id="getting-online">Getting Online</h2>
<p>The biggest annoyance with the first iteration of the auto-grader was that it was a locally-saved HTML file. This worked fine from an implementation standpoint, but many users complained. To non-tech people, the concept of a local file also being an interactable webpage is a bit obtuse, so I decided to bite the bullet and roll it out to the World Wide Web. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> made this easier than it had any right being: if any changes have been pushed to the main branch of the project&rsquo;s Github, Netlify rolls these changes out to the production website. Their free tier offers <strong>more</strong> than enough bandwidth (100 GB!) for this project&rsquo;s use case.</p>
<h2 id="phonics-survey-implementation">Phonics Survey Implementation</h2>
<p>I wish I could make this glorified matching form sound sexy, but I can&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no algorithm, like the previous test. It just tallies the number of words that the user clicks, does a little formatting magic, and prints the page as a PDF. Regardless, there are still some interesting details I&rsquo;d like to point out.</p>
<figure class="middle"><img src="WebsiteUsage.png"
         alt="website example"/><figcaption>
            <p>website example</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>A PDF can&rsquo;t be saved unless the student&rsquo;s name, grade, and school are entered. This plaintext goes in the filename for easy recollection of data.</li>
<li>By pulling the current date, the program can automatically mark each test as <code>[Beginning, Middle, or End of Year]</code>. This is also referenced in the filename, easing recordkeeping.</li>
<li>The Save button automatically saves the webpage as a PDF <em>with</em> the colors encoded.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="middle"><img src="PDFexample.png"
         alt="generated PDF example"/><figcaption>
            <p>generated PDF example</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="so-what">So What?</h2>
<p>Look, this isn&rsquo;t rocket surgery. In truth, even posting something something this trivial feels a bit juvenile, especially in comparison to how much cool stuff goes down on <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/11/21/reverse-engineering-the-seven-words-and-more-you-cant-say-on-tv/">Hackaday</a>. But instead of focusing on the technology, I&rsquo;d like to focus on the application and outcome.</p>
<p>Engineers love efficient solutions. But in pursuit of this efficiency, usability can be the first thing to go by the wayside. If a user doesn&rsquo;t use your tool because they can&rsquo;t figure it out, then it&rsquo;s not a good tool. My first version of this program was an objectively better solution: It used less memory, the data integrated with Excel, and it had a login system planned that allowed it to store student information to a MongoDB backend. When I showed it to users, all time-crunched and technically-challenged teachers, it was obvious over-optimization was holding back widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Around this time, I read a lot of posts from user-experience blog <a href="https://www.mobilespoon.net/2022/12/forms-completion-rates-statistics-and-takeaways.html">The Mobile Spoon</a> when working on this project, which led to an epiphany of user-central design. So I rebuilt the form, creating what amounted to an online version of the existing paper tests. I nixed the integrations, opting to instead generate a PDF which would be saved locally. I made the PDF generation idiot-proof: hitting &ldquo;Save&rdquo; names the PDF with the student&rsquo;s information and date, skips all dialog boxes, and automatically downloads to the Downloads folder.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h2>
<p>This updated program immediately began pulling it&rsquo;s weight: tests that used to take 30 minutes to grade were cut down to 5. Since CAR just hit 1000 students this year, this program (conservatively!) saved over 400 man-hours of manual test grading. Nearly every literacy coach organically mentioned this tool as a massive improvement in their end-of-year reflections. With the new consistency of data gathered, teachers were able to better identify student gaps, plan data-driven lessons, and push students to read on grade level.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li>Keep It Simple, Stupid! (KISS) This mantra has continued to ring true throughout every project I&rsquo;ve undertaken. Complexity has it&rsquo;s place, but it&rsquo;s better to have something bulletproof and simple than something flashy but unreliable.</li>
<li>Think of the user: Users won&rsquo;t necessarily appreciate that your program has O(n) space complexity. But they do appreciate being able to use your tools without an instruction manual or a degree in compsci.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>
<p>You may not be familiar with MGMT, but anyone who had a pulse in the late 2000&rsquo;s has most likely heard their work.
Don&rsquo;t believe me? Give this a listen and tell me it doesn&rsquo;t ring a bell.</p>

<p>Widely considered a two-hit-wonder by the radio-listening public (the other being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9dSYgd5Elk">Time to Pretend</a>),
MGMT seemed destined to a fate of former-pop-star obscurity.
So two years after their smash-hit album Oracular Spectacular,
MGMT released their sprawling, hook-less sophomore effort Congratulations to unanimous critical &hellip; confusion.
But, Contratulations wasn&rsquo;t an intentional career suicide attempt (as many critics quickly branded it); it was the album that MGMT <em>needed</em> to make.</p>
<p>MGMT was on top of the world in 2008, and they didn&rsquo;t know what to do about it.
Their debut album had just gone gold in the US and double platinum in the UK. They headlined at music festivals and toured with Radiohead and Paul McCartney.
Not too bad for a project that Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden never intended to be any more than a joke.
At Wesleyan University, MGMT was known as the band that performed the Ghostbusters theme for 45 minutes straight in snowman costumes.
Even their name, MGMT, was a sardonic reference to their goal to &ldquo;sell out as quickly as possible&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Management&rdquo; of the corporate music conglomerate.
VanWyngarden puts it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we wrote <em>Time to Pretend</em>, we were totally taking the piss out of the rock star thing. And all of a sudden that song was, like, a single, and we had to play it every day for ‚Ä¶ two ‚Ä¶ years.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an artist, what do you do when your entire career is built on totally disingenuous work?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re MGMT, you release Congratulations.</p>
<figure class="small"><img src="AlbumCover.png"

</figure>

<p>The ascending, reverb-soaked guitar prepending <em>It&rsquo;s Working</em> signals that MGMT has changed dramatically since 2008.
Lyrics dreaming of hyper-stardom are traded for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu9ykgGUm1w">Yes</a>-adjacent nonsense.
Gone are the rudimentary-yet-addictive synth hooks and bombastic Fridmann drums.
In their place are surf guitars, 60&rsquo;s organs, and harpsichords (???).
Producer Sonic Boom (of Spacemen 3 fame) earns his pay: this is a well, albeit strangely, produced album.
Production quirks like the beater-less kick drum in <em>Song for Dan Treacy</em> and massive, &lsquo;verbed out snare in <em>Siberian Breaks</em> utilize familiar instruments in offbeat ways, seemingly for strangeness&rsquo; sake alone.
The album is lush at times, and at others jarring and oblique.
But this instrumentation is just a jumping-off point for Congratulations&rsquo; most notable and interesting aspect: it&rsquo;s songwriting.</p>
<p>Congratulations is crazy and yet, it&rsquo;s also strangely addictive.
In many ways, Congratulations is an anti-Tame Impala album.
Instead of meticulously crafting buildups to emotional peaks of payoff, Congratulations opts to chase rabbit trails and go off the beaten path.
Lead-off track <em>It&rsquo;s Working</em> places half-second pauses between its distinct segments, seemingly acknowledging the musical incompatibility of each idea.
It&rsquo;s as if MGMT themselves don&rsquo;t even know how to string them together and ask you, the listener, to fill in the gaps.
Each song contains up to six or seven of these separate ideas, held together only by the common thread of instrumentation.
At times, it&rsquo;s confusing and dense and claustrophobic.
But in doing this, MGMT create their own brand of buildup.
The chaos of the first two verses in standout track <em>Flash Delirium</em> is used to greater multiply the spectacle of the bombastic, Spector-esque outro.
This songwriting method allows MGMT to build towards payoff without making these peaks feel cheap or manufactured.
On this musical journey, MGMT are enthusiastic local guides instead of corporate tour coordinators.</p>
<p>This album can best be described as isolated, consistent flashes of greatness.
Interestingly, this description mirrors MGMT&rsquo;s response to the dilemma of to pop-stardom in the first place.
A joke band that broke up and re-formed after being headhunted by Columbia Records, their fame only lasted as long as their songs remained on the top 40.
But instead of clinging desperately to relevance, MGMT took a bold step away from financial and career security in favor of their own artistic integrity.
This album stands as a musical reminder that but it takes real boldness to step away from fame and success, but the rewards of artistic freedom are much sweeter than the bitterness of being chained to other peoples&rsquo; expectations.</p>

<h2 id="why-mymirror">Why myMirror?</h2>
<p>When I wake up in the morning, there&rsquo;s a lot I know I probably should do.
For example, I should probably prepare for the day ahead by checking the weather and my daily calendar.
But often times, <strong>I just don&rsquo;t</strong>. For situations like this, myMirror is here to help.</p>
<p>myMirror solves the above dilemma by integrating this crucial information into your everyday bathroom mirror.
myMirror is a <em>smart mirror</em> with an embedded display screen,
displaying the current time and date, weather for your area, and personal Google Calendar reminders.
It even features a motion sensor, turning off the display to save power when a user isn&rsquo;t detected.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<figure class="middle"><img src="Software.png"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>The software side of myMirror</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the software side, myMirror is essentially a specialized website. It&rsquo;s written in pure Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
It utilizes the Open Weather Maps and Google Calendar APIs to display this information to the user.
The mirror itself is a pane of one-way glass with a 3.5&quot; display is mounted behind it.
A modified Raspberry Pi drives the display and handles the power management alongside the motion sensor.</p>
<h3 id="what-did-you-do">What did you do?</h3>
<p>myMirror was my idea, so I ended up leading the charge to get this project finished in 24 hours.
As the team lead, I had to check in with others, keep morale up, and delegate tasks where I wasn&rsquo;t the best person for the job.
But I did quite a bit of programming myself! I handled the hardware side of myMirror.
This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modifying the pi to drive a display with non-standard resolution and aspect ratios</li>
<li>Programming a daemon that interfaces with xScreenSaver to unblank the screen when motion is detected</li>
<li>Automating the execution of the program in case of power loss or a hard reboot</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next-for-mymirror">What&rsquo;s next for myMirror?</h2>
<p>There are a few upgrades we&rsquo;re considering implementing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First off, we want a serious codebase refresh. Anything written in 24 hours could stand to be written again in a cleaner, more concise way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, a bigger display. 3.5&quot;x2&quot; is just too small for any sizeable mirror.
The next step will most likely be the Raspberry Pi Foundation&rsquo;s own official 7&quot; display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More Information! With great display space comes great responsibility: to fill that space with relevant data!
Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texas A&amp;M Bus Schedule - Either using code swiped from Buswarn or the Texas A&amp;M Transport website.
myMirror could display what time the next bus arrives at your stop, or it the transport map itself!</li>
<li>Spotify - This could be as simple as a progress bar with information about the current song you&rsquo;re listening to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where--when">Where / When?</h2>
<p>TamuHack 2022, Jan 29-30 2022.
TamuHack is a Hackathon, a contest where teams of 4 engineers have 24 hours to design, implement, and present a product to industry judges.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>myMirror won first place in the novice division at TamuHack 2022.
But I walked away from this competition with more than just newfound pride and acute sleep deprivation.
As the team lead, I didn&rsquo;t really have time to hunker down and work on my own thing, which was a new experience for me.
But through this process I learned to sit back and trust people to do their work well.
When a small team of skilled people all play to their strengths, crazy ideas like myMirror can actually come to life!</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in!</p>

One perk of being a programmer is the ability to automate boring, repetitive tasks to ease my workload. But what&amp;rsquo;s even more rewarding is the opportunity to help non-programmers with their data analysis drudgery. Such is the case with this project.

<p>One perk of being a programmer is the ability to automate boring, repetitive tasks to ease my workload.
But what&rsquo;s even more rewarding is the opportunity to help non-programmers with their data analysis drudgery.
Such is the case with this project.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>My mom works for <a href="https://www.catchupandread.org/">Catch Up and Read</a>, a Dallas non-profit that helps below-reading-level
students catch up before third grade.
Their problem was quickly and easily grading third-grade spelling tests.
By analyzing patterns of how a student misspells words,
a smart teacher can determine what concepts that student struggles with and modify their lesson plan accordingly.
This analysis is tedious, requires a fair amount of calculation, and if you&rsquo;ve made it this far you know where this is going.
<strong>Automation!!</strong></p>
<h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
<p>This program had an interesting soup of additional constraints that made it especially fun to write:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program must be intuitive - Any teacher should be able to walk up and use it without training. This means the program needs to be extremely robust and have a very pretty user interface.</li>
<li>The program must be easily distributable - It can&rsquo;t require installing a program or programming language onto the user&rsquo;s computer</li>
<li>The program has to be accessible through public school wifi - no easy feat with archaic whitelist-based firewalls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these constraints, I decided to commit a cardinal sin of web development - combining css, javascript, and HTML on a single file.
Doing so would allow me to distribute an HTML file containing the program to teachers, bypassing the firewall issue entirely.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<figure class="middle"><img src="chunks.png"
         alt="the many chunks of the English language"/><figcaption>
            <p>the many chunks of the English language</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jumping right in: each word on the test can be split up into chunks, all of which are seen above.
Teachers normally go through each word the child has misspelled and determine which chunks have been missed.
They then tally up each of these incorrect chunks and highlight the most missed chunks on the sheet seen above.</p>
<p>In order to mimic this behavior, my program splits the word into &ldquo;runs&rdquo; of vowels and consonants.
English also has more complex chunks made up of vowels and consonants: the program uses Regex to handle these special cases.
For the intents and purposes of this program (and the English language, for that matter) these special-case chunks are vowels.</p>
<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the word <strong>fright</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first match is <strong>fr</strong>, a run of 2 consonants</li>
<li>Next, it matches <strong>igh</strong>, a special case chunk called a Long Vowel</li>
<li>Finally, the program matches t, a single consonant</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this word chunked up is <code>['fr', 'igh', 't']</code>
Below is an example of how the program grades a student who entered &lsquo;freit&rsquo; instead of fright.</p>
<figure class="middle"><img src="diagram.png"
         alt="grading &amp;lsquo;freit&amp;rsquo;"/><figcaption>
            <p>grading &lsquo;freit&rsquo;</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to grade the incorrect word, we need to chunk-ify the correct word and compare the two.
We first (1) determine the vowel-consonant pattern of the valid word: for &lsquo;fright&rsquo;, this pattern is <code>[consonant, vowel, consonant]</code>.
Then, we (2) split each word&rsquo;s chunks into two queues: one for vowels, and the other for consonants. (step 2)
We then use this pattern to (3) dequeue the vowels and consonants in the correct order
and determine if they match. Finally, we (4) count up every incorrect chunk and display it back to the user.</p>
<figure class="middle"><img src="ChunkExample.png"
         alt="word analysis section of program"/><figcaption>
            <p>word analysis section of program</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><em>Word Analysis</em></p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;blayde&rdquo; marks both &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &rsquo;e&rsquo; incorrect because together they form an incorrect long vowel.</li>
<li>when the program doesn&rsquo;t have enough chunks to work with, as is the case with &ldquo;kat&rdquo; being entered for the word &ldquo;camped&rdquo;, it marks these extra chunks as incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p><figure class="right"><img src="ChunkAnalysis.png"
         alt="chunk analysis program section"/><figcaption>
            <p>chunk analysis program section</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<em>Chunk Analysis</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The analysis section displays which chunks a student has had repeated issues with.</li>
<li>If the student&rsquo;s answer differs greatly from the vowel-consonant pattern of the correct word,
the program can mark chunks as wrong, even if they were correct in their own context.
By clicking on these wrongly-marked chunks, they can be factored out of the calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Outside of the core program, the difficulty of this this project lay in the sheer number of edge cases.
Word endings, long vowels, and unmatching vowel-consonant patterns all had to be handled gracefully.
<del>While it would have been great to deploy this to a website to show it off, saving the file locally just made more sense.</del>
The webapp is now up and running, hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>! See the <a href="">update</a> here.</p>
<p>In the future, I&rsquo;d love to expand this program to work with the Spanish-language tests as well.
Doing so would be a slog (mo chunks, mo problems). If anyone wants to take a crack at decoding Spanish, here&rsquo;s the

			<description>All digital music listeners are equal. Acquisition is painless. Taste is irrelevant. It is pointless to boast about your iTunes collection, or the quality of your playlists on a streaming service. Music became data, one more set of 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s lurking in your hard drive, invisible to see and impossible to touch. Nothing is less cool than data. ~ David Sax
Physical media is back. vinyl and cassette sales are through the roof, and why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they be?</description>

<p>All digital music listeners are equal. Acquisition is painless. Taste is irrelevant. It is pointless to boast about your iTunes collection, or the quality of your playlists on a streaming service.

</blockquote>
<p>Physical media is back. vinyl and cassette sales are through the roof, and why shouldn&rsquo;t they be? Digital music services have deprived us of that tactile feel of dropping a needle onto a well-worn album, and the intimate experience of pulling a record from its sleeve.<br>
But today I&rsquo;m focusing on the least flashy member of the physical media family: CDs.</p>
<h2 id="why-cds">Why CDs?</h2>
<p>Everyone loves CDs. Seriously, even though it&rsquo;s been a decade since anyone&rsquo;s used a CD player,
popping open a jewel case brings warm nostalgic memories to the forefront of our minds.
But besides the nostalgia factor, why bother with CDs?</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, CDs are highly customizable. Don&rsquo;t like the ending of a song? Wish the crossfade was smoother between a few tracks on a playlist? Spend half an hour with editing software such as <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, and you can turn your digital playlists into mixtapes that rival albums and surpass playlists in musicality and momentum.</li>
<li>CD players are cheap, and most modern vehicles still have them. Unlike a phone, your favorite mixtape won&rsquo;t run out of battery!</li>
<li>If you have an artistic bent, you can make CD art with nothing more than a few sharpie markers, like this!</li>
</ul>
<figure class="middle"><img src="https://i.redd.it/mnz4x8mxc5iz.jpg"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>Note: not my art, belongs to reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/themurlocs/comments/6w8470/sometimes_i_get_carried_away_with_my_burnt_cd/">mddecker</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to burn your own CDs using Windows Media Player or similar software, you know the results are much less than ideal.
Because WMP burns the entire tracklist track-by-track, the CD player needs a half-second gap between <strong>each track</strong>.
While an eloquent solution to be sure, this understandably kills an album&rsquo;s flow, it&rsquo;s momentum.</p>
<p>So why do retail CDs not have this issue?
Well, instead of burning track by track, retail CDs are burned in DAO, or Disk-At-Once mode.
Doing so encodes the track boundaries in the CD&rsquo;s metadata, which in turn tells the CD player <em>exactly</em> where each track starts and ends. No gaps!
Burning discs in DAO mode gives other benefits as well. Want track names that are visible on the CD Player? Want secret tracks akin to runout grooves on old records? All these are possible with DAO burning.</p>
<p>DAO burning software was once exorbitantly expensive and hard to track down.
But luckily, our friends in the open-source community have a solution: <a href="http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/">cdrdao</a>.</p>
<h1 id="using-cdrdao">Using CDRDAO</h1>
<p>CDRDAO is a command-line only program. but don&rsquo;t be scared!
Dear reader, I&rsquo;ve done just about everything I can to make using this powerful program as easy as possible!
However, you&rsquo;ll need a few things first.</p>
<ul>
<li>a computer that <strong>has A DVD RW Drive</strong> and is running some distribution of <strong>Linux</strong>.</li>
<li>my <a href="https://github.com/ethan-cope/cdrdao-tools">code</a> from github</li>
<li>music files to be burned to a CD: .wav, m4a, or mp3 files</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="downloading-needed-programs">Downloading needed programs</h2>
<p>here, you need cdrdao and ffmpeg. both can be acquired from your friendly neighborhood package manager.</p>
<p>On Arch Linux:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo pacman -S cdrdao ffmpeg 
</code></pre><h2 id="converting-files-to-wav">Converting files to .wav</h2>
<p>Cdrdao only works with .wav files. If your tracks are pulled from iTunes, they might be .m4a, or possibly .mp3 files.
ffmpeg makes converting them relatively easy, but I also wrote a script that makes this process even more simple!
This script quickly converts all the files in a directory of a given extension to .wav files, which can work with cdrdao!
Here&rsquo;s how to use it:</p>
<ol>
<li>in <code>convertToWav.sh</code>, modify the <code>FILES</code> variable to reflect the file type you&rsquo;re converting from. For example:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">FILES</span><span class="o">=</span>*.m4a <span class="c1"># this will convert all .m4a files in the directory to .wav files</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nv">FILES</span><span class="o">=</span>*.mp3 <span class="c1"># this will convert all .mp3 files in the directory to .wav files</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">

to work around this, change the extension to <code>.wav</code>, and run the conversion program!</p>
<h2 id="song-number-shifting">Song Number Shifting</h2>
<p>When burning with CDRDAO, all your tracks need to be in the same directory.
In order to preserve song order, each track is numbered like so: <code>'01 In This State.wav'</code>
If you&rsquo;re building a mixtape song-by-song, manually re-numbering tracks is no problem.
But if you&rsquo;re putting multiple songs from the same source on a disc, this gets tedious. enter <code>songShift.sh</code>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use an example for this one. I have 3 directories: <code>Album1</code>, <code>Album2</code>, which contain songs I want to combine into one CD,
and <code>Mixtape</code>, which will hold the final album .wav files in the correct order.
Let&rsquo;s say we want to put Album2 after Album1, and Album1 is 8 tracks long.
Then we&rsquo;ll run the program like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">songShift.sh &lt;path to Album2&gt; <span class="m">8</span> <span class="c1">#shifting all track numbers by 8</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">cp &lt;path to Album2&gt;/*.wav &lt;path to Mixtape&gt; <span class="c1"># copying all the shifted songs to the Mixtape dir.</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="generating-toc">Generating TOC</h2>
<p>Cdrdao uses a TOC (or Table Of Contents) file as a template for the contents of the CD. This file contains the track listings, and is used to burn the CD with pretty track names.
Full documentation for TOC files is found <a href="https://tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-CD-Burning/dao-burning.html">here</a>.
I wrote a script to take some of the tedium out of generating these TOC files.
Simply run the program as follows!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">genToc.sh &lt;path to directory with .tracks&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="burning-cd">Burning CD</h2>
<p>The next step is simulating the CD burn, which allows you to catch any errors before actually burning the CD.
Just run <code>cdrdao simulate</code> in the same directory as the TOC file and .wav files. If this doesn&rsquo;t spit out any errors, you&rsquo;re ready to burn!
Run the following command to burn the CD!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cdrdao write --driver generic-mmc-raw --eject (toc file name) 
</code></pre><h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>I was really interested in doing all of this from the Linux command line, so there are no instructions for Windows. I know a Windows version of CDRDAO exists, so best of luck translating these instructions to Microsoft-ese, Windows users!</li>
<li>I also eventually want to modify the wav converter to work with files other than m4a.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="small-aside">Small Aside</h3>
<p>A few people claim that CD sound quality is bad, 44.1 kHz music isn&rsquo;t high-res enough,
and that <em>they</em> can hear the difference between low and high bitrate music.
While this indeed used to be the case (with <em>extremely</em> low bitrate music), it is no longer true.
Don&rsquo;t believe me? Check out <a href="https://www.soundguys.com/high-bitrate-audio-is-overkill-cd-quality-is-still-great-16518/">this article</a>!</p>

			<title>Echo-Matic Deluxe (Part 1): Marantz-based DIY Tape Echo</title>

			<description>Back in 2019, I saw the influential space-rock group Wand live. It was an amazing set of mostly new tunes, but I was a tad distracted by their lead guitarist. He was fiddling with a battered green box for the whole set, and doing so sent his guitar part soaring over the rest of the band in the most atmospheric, gooey wash imaginable. This was my first introduction to the weird, wonderful world of tape echo, and I wanted one!</description>

<p>Back in 2019, I saw the influential space-rock group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9PcHA5Ievk">Wand</a> live.
It was an amazing set of mostly new tunes, but I was a tad distracted by their lead guitarist.
He was fiddling with a battered green box for the whole set, and doing so sent his guitar part soaring over the rest of the band in the most atmospheric, gooey wash imaginable.
This was my first introduction to the weird, wonderful world of tape echo, and I wanted one!</p>
<p>Sadly, vintage tape echoes (such as the Roland RE201 Cory was using that night) go for
<em><strong><a href="https://reverb.com/p/roland-space-echo-re-201">thousands</a></strong></em>
on the used market, and are notoriously finnicky to maintain.
Cheaper digital emulations unsurprisingly fail to capture the warm, fuzzy magic of these complex analog devices.
But one day I stumbled on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABU-psBnmxk">youtube video</a> demonstrating a DIY tape echo built from nothing more than a few analog components and a tape deck, and I knew I had to make one!</p>
<h2 id="the-theory">The Theory</h2>
<p>Conceptually, tape echo is pretty simple. Consider a tape deck with 3 heads: a record head, a monitor head, and an erase head.
When recording on a 3-head deck, the signal that&rsquo;s just been recorded to the tape by the record head is captured and sent out via the playback head.
But when you send this monitor output signal directly back into the line-in jack, a feedback loop is created,
and your original sound is repeated.
From there, all you need are controls!</p>
<ul>
<li>Varying the speed of the tape deck motor changes the speed of the tape, which in turn controls the delay time.</li>
<li>Adding a resistance in the feedback loop controls the amount of signal fed back into the unit, which in turn varies the number of delay repeats.</li>
<li>Add a potentiometer to control the wet/dry mix and a volume output knob, and you have a tape delay!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-circuit">The Circuit</h2>
<p>The circuit I&rsquo;m utilizing is a modified version of <a href="https://proto-schlock.blogspot.com/2015/04/echo-matic-diy-tape-delay.html">Proto-Schlock&rsquo;s</a>, who in turn got it from Boscorelli&rsquo;s <em>the StompBox Cookbook</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>My most notable modification is the addition of a reverb module from BYOC, to simulate the orginal RE201 unit&rsquo;s spring reverb. If you don&rsquo;t want to do this, just connect <code>TO_RV</code> and <code>FROM_RV</code> with a jumper wire.</li>
<li>I also added a low-pass filter to the feedback loop, since high frequencies tend to make my unit self-oscillate.
you should experiment with different filters and filter designs here!</li>
</ul>

         alt="image"/><figcaption>

</figure>

<h2 id="the-materials">The Materials</h2>
<p>Ebay is a wonderful place. One where you can get a late 70&rsquo;s 3-head stereo tape recorder for $40 + shipping.
These old Marantz 3-head decks still have a pretty devoted following, so this unit was an absolute steal!
I already had a DIY spring reverb pedal from <a href="https://buildyourownclone.com/">BYOC</a> lying around, which would emulate the gooey reverb of the original unit without having to buy a separate reverb tank.
The rest of the parts for this project were relatively easy to source at <a href="https://smallbear-electronics.mybigcommerce.com/">Small Bear</a>, my go-to for quality guitar pedal components. I&rsquo;ve included a BOM for the project in the Github Repo.</p>
<h2 id="the-build">The Build</h2>
<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
<p>After acquiring all the parts, it was prototyping time!</p>
<figure><img src="breadboard1.jpeg"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>not the cleanest, I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Despite the circuit&rsquo;s complexity, breadboarding wasn&rsquo;t all that bad.
I hooked it up to the tape deck and&hellip; it worked! In retrospect, I&rsquo;m really glad I tested this on the breadboard first.
Doing so let me experiment with a few different high-pass filter designs before I decided on the one in the schematic.</p>
<h3 id="motor-control">Motor Control</h3>
<p>Next step: modifying the motor controller. Some tape units have this functionality built-in, but mine didn&rsquo;t. to work around this, I coupled the motor to it&rsquo;s power source via a PWM controller.
It&rsquo;s ideal to have this PWM frequency above the audio range (greater than 20 kHz).</p>
<p>or&hellip; at least it would. For some reason, my PWM controllers didn&rsquo;t want to play nice with the tape deck&rsquo;s motor.
I ended up going the analog route of putting a potentiometer inline with the motor to control the motor speed.
Every motor is different, but mine stalled at any resistance over 50 Ohms.</p>

         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>the finished board</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Finally, it was time to manufacture.
If you want to make this project yourself, I&rsquo;ve provided the Autodesk Eagle .brd files in the Github repo. Note that this is the first time I&rsquo;ve designed a pcb, so it may not be perfect! I manufactured it with <a href="https://aisler.net/">Aisler</a>,
and only paid $10 for 3 boards!</p>
<h2 id="part-1-thoughts">Part 1 Thoughts</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a while before I get back on this project.
Aisler takes about a month to manufacture, and junior year is starting up. Stay tuned for a part 2!</p>

What is Buswarn? During the COVID year, I moved off-campus. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize at the time, but my only lifeline to my in-person classes, study rooms, and meals would be the Texas A&amp;amp;M Bus Transit System. Problems manifested themselves quickly. Buses ran at seemingly random intervals, and the website that displayed the schedule often had errors rendering on my mobile phone.</description>

<h2 id="what-is-buswarn">What is Buswarn?</h2>
<p>During the COVID year, I moved off-campus. I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time, but my only lifeline to my in-person classes, study rooms, and meals would be the Texas A&amp;M Bus Transit System.
Problems manifested themselves quickly. Buses ran at seemingly random intervals, and the website that displayed the schedule often had errors rendering on my mobile phone.
What I needed was a simple device that displayed how many minutes I had to wait until the next bus arrived at my apartment.
This device wouldn&rsquo;t require me to have the foresight of googling the schedule and doing mental math to determine what time to leave my apartment in order to make the next bus.
Armed with these design goals, I set to work with a Raspberry Pi and few 7-segment displays I had lying around.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the birds-eye view of how the code works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the schedule website for the desired route from the internet every morning</li>
<li>Process the timetable, and generate a list of times buses will arrive at my bus stop</li>
<li>Compare the current time with next bus arrival time, and print the difference to a 7-segment display</li>
<li>Gracefully handle website outages and power cycles to the pi.</li>
<li>Turn the pi off at the end of the day and repeat</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Buswarn was written in Python, and I have bits of it written in C in case I want to implement it on a Arduino later down the road.</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to use this as an opportunity to bone up on my HTML skills, and ended up using the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML table into a Python array.</li>
<li>The LCD is controlled by a custom Python library that can be used on using on future projects.</li>
<li>This is the first project I&rsquo;ve developed entirely remotely through SSH on a headless machine.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="big"><img src="operation.gif"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>prototype working fine!</p>
        </figcaption>

<h2 id="constraints-and-challenges">Constraints and Challenges</h2>
<p>This project&rsquo;s main challenge was writing an extremely resilient program that could be left to run without breaking for extended periods of time.
In practice, this meant handling a <strong>LOT</strong> of edge cases.
For example, on football game days the website I pulled information from was essentially offline.
Handling these edge cases individually offered me total control over the program&rsquo;s stability. It&rsquo;s been running for a few months now with no errors whatsoever!
Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://github.com/ethan-cope/pybuswarn">Github Repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="future-changes">Future Changes</h2>
<p><em>in order from least to most difficult to implement</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Nokia 5110 display suits this project much better than 7-segments.
The 5110 is a 84x48 px lcd display with a backlight, which consumes less power and is much more visible in high-brightness environments.
I&rsquo;ve been having problems getting it to work on the Pi, so it&rsquo;s currently on the drawing board.</li>
<li>A classic engineering problem: it works, but it&rsquo;s not exactly pretty. even a 3d printed enclosure would go a long way to make it more presentable.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d love to eventually build these as low-power self-contained nodes in a LORA mesh. This would allow these stations to be installed at any bus station that has sunlight, no internet or power required.
I&rsquo;ll explore this possibility when I delve more into my self-contained LORA mesh project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>
<p>This project taught me loads about building a program to an incredibly high reliability standard, and directly influenced my development mindset when tackling programming challenges at Stanley Black &amp; Decker.</p>
