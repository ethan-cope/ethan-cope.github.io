<p>As an engineer, it&rsquo;s impossible to visit Japan and not be obsessed with its trains. From record-breaking bullet trains to spaghetti-like subway networks, Japan does trains better than anywhere else I&rsquo;ve been.
But even the most train-obsessed nations acknowledge that heavy rail isn&rsquo;t a catch-all solution. So as a bit of a curveball, I&rsquo;m writing this transit post about everything <em>but</em> the trains in Japan.</p>

            <p>Osaka&rsquo;s Hankai Tram line - it&rsquo;s seen better days</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Right out of the gate, we&rsquo;ll start with something train-adjacent: Trams. These overgrown rails (above) are all that remain of Osaka&rsquo;s once sprawling suburban tram network. In the early 20th century, gas-powered buses could only carry a few people at a time. Short of a real train, trams like these were really the only solution for urban transit. Trams were once <em>everywhere</em> - take a peek at this ~1920s map of Osaka, and try to find a major road <em>without</em> a tram line!</p>
<figure><img src="images/osaka1920sMap.jpg"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>Part of a 1920&rsquo;s map of Osaka: the black lines in the middle of the roads are trams! (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/papertowns/comments/qkal5d/japan_detailed_map_of_osaka_in_the_1920s/">image credit</a>)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Osaka may have had miles of tram lines, but it wouldn&rsquo;t last long.
Buses became more and more efficient, and they didn&rsquo;t require expensive rails or electricity lines like trams did.
As buses continued to grow in popularity, Osaka&rsquo;s (and indeed, Japan&rsquo;s) tram lines began closing for business.
Just like <a href="/posts/sftransit/">San Francisco</a>, the only lines that survived were the ones that couldn&rsquo;t be converted into high-density streets.</p>
<figure><img src="images/osakaTram.png"
         alt="image"/>
</figure>

<p>So it was with Osaka&rsquo;s only remaining tram line, the Hankai line. The Hankai doesn&rsquo;t even reach downtown Osaka anymore. Not a problem - most commuters would favor the faster subway lines a stone&rsquo;s throw away. Now, its purpose is more local - connecting the entertainment district of Shinsekai, the ancient Sumiyoshi Taisha shrine, and any requested stops in between.</p>
<p>To me, this is exactly where trams shine. Buses are efficient, but communities don&rsquo;t spring up around bus stops. Conversely, tram lines historically become the backbone of tight-knit &ldquo;streetcar suburbs&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Community&rdquo; may be a tough sell to cash-strapped public transit agencies.
But with smaller cities in Japan (Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki) opting to invest further in trams over subways, maybe trams will have their long-delayed resurgence after all.</p>

<p>By the 1970s, most people saw trains as dingy, outdated anachronisms. Why travel by rail if a jet can get you there faster, and in style?
However, one form of transit still captured the public&rsquo;s imagination: <em>The Monorail</em>.
At one point, Washington DC and LA were actively considering futuristic monorails for their brand new public transit networks.
The future was now!</p>

<td style="text-align:center"><em>Tokyo&rsquo;s (normal, non-suspended) monorail</em></td>
<td style="text-align:center"><em>Nagoya&rsquo;s Maglev (though this train technically levitates, making it a zero-rail?)</em></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And what&rsquo;s not to like? Monorails are undoubtedly futuristic, and elevated tracks take up less space and block less sunlight in dense cities.
Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s where the list of upsides end.
Monorails are much more complicated than normal trains - switching tracks means moving massive blocks of concrete. Monorail tunnels actually need to be <em>taller</em> than the equivalent train tunnel, since the tracks themselves are taller. Finally, if you&rsquo;re running a transit agency, you can&rsquo;t swap the cars between standard rail or vice versa - they&rsquo;re monorail or nothing.
Because of this, most monorails of this era were essentially vanity projects for municipalities with money to burn. Think Disney World, Las Vegas, and&hellip; 1980s Japan. After Tokyo&rsquo;s first monorail (In 1964!), they began popping up all over: in Fukuoka (1985), Chiba (1988), Osaka (1990) and Tokyo again (1998). But of Japan&rsquo;s monorails, the coolest is undoubtedly Mitsubishi Electric&rsquo;s Suspended <em>Shonan Monorail</em>.</p>

<p>Americans may know Mitsubishi as the producer of America&rsquo;s cheapest car and not much else. But in Japan, Mitsubishi Industries is a household name for air conditioners, aircraft, and construction equipment. And in the 1970s, they were at the top of their game. What would be a better symbol of their technological prowess than a hyper-complicated suspended monorail running past their front door? (Like I mentioned earlier - vanity project!) The Shonan Monorail cars dangle below an elevated track, giving a phenomenal (if a tad scary) view of the scenery below. This also means the cars swing outwards around the bends, just like a theme park ride. The crazy thing is, normal people still ride this every day to get to work! I&rsquo;m definitely not the only fan - when I rode, a whole crowd of people were lined up to take pictures and videos at the front of the train. As far as I can tell, there&rsquo;s no practical reason for the Shonan line to be a hanging monorail - it&rsquo;s just cool!</p>

<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking - Ethan, Japan is the land of public transit! Why are you writing about cars here? Also, haven&rsquo;t you <a href="">written an entire article</a> about Japanese cars before? Correct on both counts - here I want to break down how cars fit into Japan&rsquo;s transit landscape, and how that differs from the States.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like owning a car is cheap in Japan. The second you buy a car, you&rsquo;re immediately hit with a bevy of one-time and yearly taxes. Yearly taxes include a tax on engine size (displacement) and vehicle weight. One-time taxes are based off of how &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; the car is and the sale price of the car (consumption tax). As an example, buying a Toyota RAV4 (currently the most popular car in the US) would would be taxed ~$2500 (consumption tax) + $1000 (environmental tax) off the bat. Then, you&rsquo;d owe an additional $305 (displacement tax) + $105 (weight tax) + $500 inspection yearly.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Oh, and the car only cost $31,000 begin with! Finally, gas is taxed at $.40 a gallon and every highway is a toll road. Ouch.</p>
<figure><img src="images/toyotaSpade.jpg"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>My friend&rsquo;s whip of choice - the Toyota Spade. The name is apparently a portmanteau of the words <em>Space</em> and <em>Wide</em>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unsurprisingly, nearly every Japanese market car is built to dodge as many taxes as possible. Case in point, my friend&rsquo;s Toyota Spade. It only weighs 2400 lbs, nearly half that of the RAV4. With a tiny 1.3L engine, it&rsquo;s taxed at only 2/3s what a RAV4 costs.
Of course, building a usable car this light requires ingenuity, which the Spade has - well - in spades. The Spade is like a two-door, but the passenger door slides open like a minivan! This lets six-footers like my friend to access the (surprisingly large) backseat with ease. The tax metagaming can go even deeper. If my friend wasn&rsquo;t so tall, he could opt for an even smaller, lighter <em>kei-car</em> for maximum tax optimization!</p>
<figure><img src="images/mitsuoka.png"
         alt="image"/><figcaption>
            <p>If you want big car styling for small car money, Mitsuoka has you covered. You can buy a 3/4 size Challenger right off of the lot!</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Why would someone in Japan bother jumping through these hoops in the first place? Just like in the US, geography plays a big role. Trains and buses may be less frequent in the suburbs, and in rural areas they may not exist at all. If you own a business, you&rsquo;re not going to deliver your goods by train. So for many, owning a car may be less of a luxury and more a way of life. Finally, road trips are just as popular in Japan as they are in the States. Not surprising to me - if you live in a city of 37 million, sometimes you need to get away from it all. For locals and tourists alike, cars are the still the best way to explore non-urban Japan.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about it for this transit roundup! There were a few options I didn&rsquo;t get to try on my most recent trip (overnight ferry, cable car) and one I&rsquo;ve already written about (<a href="/posts/twodaysinnagoya/">Maglev</a>). Thanks for tuning in, and let me know if there any other forms of transit I should check out on my next visit!</p>
