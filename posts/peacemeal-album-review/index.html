			</header>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Ron Gallo, <strong>PEACEMEAL</strong>: (March 5, 2021)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been eagerly anticipating this album since the first single, &ldquo;HIDE (MYSELF BEHIND YOU)&rdquo; was released. This track&rsquo;s chorus-drenched guitar and almost-dancebeat are a far cry from Ron&rsquo;s early, fuzz and scuzz garage work. Of course, a lot has happened since <strong>HEAVY META</strong> was released. After a few U.S. tours, two E.P.s and a marriage, Ron&rsquo;s been pretty busy since 2017. But in trading his fuzz pedals for drum machines, what initially appears to be a kitschy sell out is revealed as something&hellip; <em>deeper</em>.</p>
<p>Gallo&rsquo;s taken a new direction in more than just style &ndash; lyrically, <strong>PEACEMEAL</strong> is a natural evolution of Ron&rsquo;s vivid, descriptive and intensely honest style. But instead of lamenting the uncaring and often hopeless world, (a-la <strong>HEAVY META&rsquo;s</strong> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/06ROBYEV70Ry09m1QWffm4?si=28bskRgITZiQBUUDBa6ZKQ">&ldquo;Why Do You Have Kids?&quot;</a>), Ron points his critical gaze inward.
Ron&rsquo;s lyrics have always poked fun at other people, places, and ideas, but with <strong>PEACEMEAL</strong> he has a new target: himself.
In <a href="%22nl%22">&ldquo;HIDE (MYSELF BEHIND YOU&rdquo;</a>, Gallo describes the nervous and ultimately fleeting happiness found in basing one&rsquo;s identity on another person. He then underscores the irony of building up ideal expectations for people, and when they <em>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t live up to it, I question everything&rdquo;.</em> This self-awareness is again alluded to in &ldquo;Easter Island&rdquo; where he laments <em>&ldquo;Not a day goes by not dictated by what people think of me.&quot;</em>
Fortunately, Ron tackles discussing his internal problems with the same scathing criticism as he does any other topic.
Depressing, self deprecating lyrics are tinged with self-honesty we all-too-rarely experience in our daily lives.
And yet, &ldquo;YOU ARE ENOUGH&rdquo; is the positive to the album&rsquo;s negative. it&rsquo;s everything we want to believe about ourselves, even in the face of our failings. Power can be found in acknowledging our shortcomings and in finding someone to validate us.</p>
<p><strong>PEACEMEAL</strong> is a 31-minute pep-talk of an album, it&rsquo;s the lowest lows and the highest highs of diving into one&rsquo;s soul with an objective lens and laying bare every thought.
In modern popular music, authenticity is the elusive beast, the unattainable goal. There&rsquo;s a reason why songs like &ldquo;New Person, Same Old Mistakes&rdquo; hit different in comparison to generic-pop-radio trash: often, that reason is <em>authenticity</em>.
And the biggest stanout of his latest offering is that Gallo emphasizes his own trademark honesty by borrowing from the styling and production cues of historically shallow and un-authentic pop music. Lush backup vocals fill the space once occupied by screeching feedback. All of this contributes to an almost claustrophobic tone, a facade of &ldquo;Everything is OK&rdquo; that can&rsquo;t hide the .</p>
<p>peacemeal is an ode to all the tiny revelations we have throughout our lives, whether they actually go on to change our lives or not.</p>
<p>fake authenticity is a dime a dozen in modern music - but gallo comes to terms with his false authenticity just the same
stands out from music that sounds the same and isn&rsquo;t authentic
is it therapy through songwriting? maybe. But at least it&rsquo;s honest. PEACEMEAL emphasizes that us humans aren&rsquo;t perfect, and that&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p>ron is no longer beating the unhearing world over the head, and instead looking inward towards his own faults and coming to terms with them, maturity. this album had to happen</p>
<p>artists evolve and change, and in asking them to make the music that we like we&rsquo;re confining them to a state where they&rsquo;d never make the music we liked in the first place.
i&rsquo;m too optimistic to review albums i don&rsquo;t like. if it&rsquo;s here, I like it.</p>
