      <description>&lt;p&gt;Faced with the tradition of family Christmas gift giving, I was thoroughly stumped.&#xA;I knew I wanted to do something maker-related: I&amp;rsquo;m the only engineer in the family, which tends to amplify the wow factor of any techncal projects :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After my fallback plan (a Chemex coffee maker) fell through, I knew I had to build these!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ethan-cope.github.io/posts/thinking-of-you/boximg.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;the finished product!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Long-Distance-Best-Friend-Lights/&#34;&gt;long-distance friendship lanterns&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is, sometimes you want to let a distant friend or family member know that you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of them, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to shoot them a text. The lanterns couldn&amp;rsquo;t be simpler to use: turning on your lantern also turns on your friends&amp;rsquo; lantern, no matter where they are in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Public transportation is like a magnifying glass that shows you civilization up close. ~ Chris Gethard&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-buswarn&#34;&gt;What is Buswarn?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the COVID year, I moved off-campus. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize at the time, but my only lifeline to my in-person classes, study rooms, and meals would be the Texas A&amp;amp;M Bus Transit System.&#xA;Problems manifested themselves quickly. Buses ran at seemingly random intervals, and the website that displayed the schedule often had errors rendering on my mobile phone.&#xA;What I needed was a simple device that displayed how many minutes I had to wait until the next bus arrived at my apartment.&#xA;This device wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require me to have the foresight of googling the schedule and doing mental math to determine what time to leave my apartment in order to make the next bus.&#xA;Armed with these design goals, I set to work with a Raspberry Pi and few 7-segment displays I had lying around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
