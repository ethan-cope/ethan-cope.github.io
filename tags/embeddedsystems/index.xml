      <description>first prototype!
  Using the Pomodoro Technique to make a Pomodoro Timer (Part 1) A famous Henry Ford quote goes: &amp;ldquo;Nothing is particularly hard, if you divide it into small [enough] jobs&amp;rdquo;. One popular way to practically implement this advice is something called the &amp;ldquo;Pomodoro Technique&amp;rdquo;. 1
The Pomodoro Technique aims to divide the day into bite-sized, productive time chunks. The idea is to set some kind of timer for 25 minutes before you start working.</description>

      <description>Faced with the tradition of family Christmas gift giving, I was thoroughly stumped. I knew I wanted to do something maker-related: I&amp;rsquo;m the only engineer in the family, which tends to amplify the wow factor of any techncal projects :)
After my fallback plan (a Chemex coffee maker) fell through, I knew I had to build these!
 the finished product!
  These are long-distance friendship lanterns. The idea is, sometimes you want to let a distant friend or family member know that you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of them, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to shoot them a text.</description>

      <description>Public transportation is like a magnifying glass that shows you civilization up close. ~ Chris Gethard
 What is Buswarn? During the COVID year, I moved off-campus. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize at the time, but my only lifeline to my in-person classes, study rooms, and meals would be the Texas A&amp;amp;M Bus Transit System. Problems manifested themselves quickly. Buses ran at seemingly random intervals, and the website that displayed the schedule often had errors rendering on my mobile phone.</description>
