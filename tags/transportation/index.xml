  As an engineer, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to visit Japan and not be obsessed with its trains. From record-breaking bullet trains to spaghetti-like subway networks, Japan does trains better than anywhere else I&amp;rsquo;ve been. But even the most train-obsessed nations acknowledge that heavy rail isn&amp;rsquo;t a catch-all solution. So as a bit of a curveball, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this transit post about everything but the trains in Japan.</description>

      <description>As some may know, I moved to Santa Clara about a year ago. But if a non-Californian asks me where I live, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to skip the geography lesson and just say San Francisco. Despite how often I use this line, I recently realized I haven&amp;rsquo;t really explored San Francisco yet.
Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve driven in for a few concerts - but that&amp;rsquo;s not exploring. Driving is all point-to-point. Pull up to the destination and park in the least sketchy lot you can find.</description>

      <title>üèôÔ∏è Is Nagoya Boring?</title>

      <description>Recently, it seems like everyone I talk to is either visiting or returning from Japan. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just my observation - according to multiple sources, Japan&amp;rsquo;s post-covid tourism numbers are through the roof. While many plan their trips around the glitz and glamor of Tokyo or the rich culture of Kyoto, there&amp;rsquo;s another city that I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to see on any itinerary - Nagoya.
Despite being it&amp;rsquo;s third largest metro area, Nagoya is nationally renowned as &amp;ldquo;Japan&amp;rsquo;s most boring city&amp;rdquo;.</description>

  On the surface, Dallas looks like just another cookie-cutter commuter city. Compared to Austin&amp;rsquo;s booming tech industry and laid-back vibe, Dallas&#39; historic hyperfocus on sprawling office parks has always felt a bit clinical. But the combination of this all-work all-the-time culture and a early 80&amp;rsquo;s real-estate boom led to some crazy planning experiments, and none were as crazy as the Irving&amp;rsquo;s Las Colinas district.</description>

      <title>Japan&#39;s Most Iconic Model Cars Come Out Of Vending Machines</title>

      <description>Remember those 25-cent gumball machines? The ones where you could trade a quarter for a gumball older than the dotcom crash? Imagine that, but instead of a chunk of crusty candy, you win a random 1/64th scale model car. That&amp;rsquo;s essentially Gachapon!
 Bandai Namco&amp;rsquo;s toy vending machines are addictively simple. Insert cash (1), twist dial (2), and collect model (3). Since the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, Gachapon machines have dispensed billions of anime figurines, sushi keychains, and (most notably), tiny scale vehicles.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology, not the other way around. ~ Steve Jobs
 Last weekend I had the opportunity to participate in Problems Worth Solving: Texas A&amp;amp;M&amp;rsquo;s first and only entrepreneurship competition that outright bans solutions.
Great businesses arise from an intimate understanding of your customers&#39; needs. PWS emphasizes this critical step of entrepreneurship by focusing entrepreneurs on the problem, not the solution.</description>
