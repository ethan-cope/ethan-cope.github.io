      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All digital music listeners are equal. Acquisition is painless. Taste is irrelevant. It is pointless to boast about your iTunes collection, or the quality of your playlists on a streaming service. Music became data, one more set of 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s lurking in your hard drive, invisible to see and impossible to touch. Nothing is less cool than data. ~ David Sax&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Physical media is back. vinyl and cassette sales are through the roof, and why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they be? Digital music services have deprived us of that tactile feel of dropping a needle onto a well-worn album, and the intimate experience of pulling a record from its sleeve.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But today I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on the least flashy member of the physical media family: CDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Public transportation is like a magnifying glass that shows you civilization up close. ~ Chris Gethard&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-buswarn&#34;&gt;What is Buswarn?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the COVID year, I moved off-campus. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize at the time, but my only lifeline to my in-person classes, study rooms, and meals would be the Texas A&amp;amp;M Bus Transit System.&#xA;Problems manifested themselves quickly. Buses ran at seemingly random intervals, and the website that displayed the schedule often had errors rendering on my mobile phone.&#xA;What I needed was a simple device that displayed how many minutes I had to wait until the next bus arrived at my apartment.&#xA;This device wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require me to have the foresight of googling the schedule and doing mental math to determine what time to leave my apartment in order to make the next bus.&#xA;Armed with these design goals, I set to work with a Raspberry Pi and few 7-segment displays I had lying around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
