  Ouch. Is that Python or Javascript? And do I spy inline CSS styling? To quote The Talking Heads, &amp;ldquo;How did I get here?&amp;quot; After all, no one ever sets out to write bad code. While bad code can result from laziness or inexperience, I want to spend this article discussing a third source: Scope Creep.</description>

      <description>Recently, it seems like everyone I talk to is either visiting or returning from Japan. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just my observation - according to multiple sources, Japan&amp;rsquo;s post-covid tourism numbers are through the roof. While many plan their trips around the glitz and glamor of Tokyo or the rich culture of Kyoto, there&amp;rsquo;s another city that I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to see on any itinerary - Nagoya.
Despite being it&amp;rsquo;s third largest metro area, Nagoya is nationally renowned as &amp;ldquo;Japan&amp;rsquo;s most boring city&amp;rdquo;.</description>

  On the surface, Dallas looks like just another cookie-cutter commuter city. Compared to Austin&amp;rsquo;s booming tech industry and laid-back vibe, Dallas&#39; historic hyperfocus on sprawling office parks has always felt a bit clinical. But the combination of this all-work all-the-time culture and a early 80&amp;rsquo;s real-estate boom led to some crazy planning experiments, and none were as crazy as the Irving&amp;rsquo;s Las Colinas district.</description>

And the other day, I finally stumbled on across a building that proved this point. Nagoya&amp;rsquo;s Sasashima-Ribu station is totally representative of a particular architectural style; one that, at the time of it&amp;rsquo;s construction, was synonymous with &amp;ldquo;modern architecture&amp;rdquo;. But a quarter of a century has separated innovation from trend, revealing a slew of early 2000&amp;rsquo;s quintessential quirks.</description>
