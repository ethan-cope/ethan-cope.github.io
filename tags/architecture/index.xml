      <description>All-star Brutalist Skyline at Texas A&amp;amp;M
  If you went to college in the US, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few depressing buildings like these. Often called &amp;ldquo;Brutalist&amp;rdquo; architecture, maybe you also heard rumors that they were built by the Russians or designed to suppress student riots. I&amp;rsquo;ll take a crack at separating fact from fiction today, as I process what made this style so popular, and why public colleges (of all tenants) seemed to fall in love.</description>

      <description>Recently, it seems like everyone I talk to is either visiting or returning from Japan. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just my observation - according to multiple sources, Japan&amp;rsquo;s post-covid tourism numbers are through the roof. While many plan their trips around the glitz and glamor of Tokyo or the rich culture of Kyoto, there&amp;rsquo;s another city that I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to see on any itinerary - Nagoya.
Despite being it&amp;rsquo;s third largest metro area, Nagoya is nationally renowned as &amp;ldquo;Japan&amp;rsquo;s most boring city&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Sign at the entrance of the APT
  On the surface, Dallas looks like just another cookie-cutter commuter city. Compared to Austin&amp;rsquo;s booming tech industry and laid-back vibe, Dallas&#39; historic hyperfocus on sprawling office parks has always felt a bit clinical. But the combination of this all-work all-the-time culture and a early 80&amp;rsquo;s real-estate boom led to some crazy planning experiments, and none were as crazy as the Irving&amp;rsquo;s Las Colinas district.</description>

      <title>Japan&#39;s Early-2000&#39;s Architectural Nostalgia</title>

      <description>The architectural definition of &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo;1 has always been a moving target. Every year, once &amp;ldquo;stylistically cutting-edge&amp;rdquo; buildings slip into the realm of &amp;ldquo;dated&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cliche&amp;rdquo;. And the other day, I finally stumbled on across a building that proved this point. Nagoya&amp;rsquo;s Sasashima-Ribu station is totally representative of a particular architectural style; one that, at the time of it&amp;rsquo;s construction, was synonymous with &amp;ldquo;modern architecture&amp;rdquo;. But a quarter of a century has separated innovation from trend, revealing a slew of early 2000&amp;rsquo;s quintessential quirks.</description>
