      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All digital music listeners are equal. Acquisition is painless. Taste is irrelevant. It is pointless to boast about your iTunes collection, or the quality of your playlists on a streaming service. Music became data, one more set of 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s lurking in your hard drive, invisible to see and impossible to touch. Nothing is less cool than data. ~ David Sax&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Physical media is back. vinyl and cassette sales are through the roof, and why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t they be? Digital music services have deprived us of that tactile feel of dropping a needle onto a well-worn album, and the intimate experience of pulling a record from its sleeve.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But today I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on the least flashy member of the physical media family: CDs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
