      <description>Ron Gallo, PEACEMEAL: (March 5, 2021)
I&amp;rsquo;ve been eagerly anticipating this album since the first single, &amp;ldquo;HIDE (MYSELF BEHIND YOU)&amp;rdquo; was released. This track&amp;rsquo;s chorus-drenched guitar and almost-dancebeat are a far cry from Ron&amp;rsquo;s early, fuzz and scuzz garage work. Of course, a lot has happened since HEAVY META was released. After a few U.S. tours, two E.P.s and a marriage, Ron&amp;rsquo;s been pretty busy since 2017. But in trading his fuzz pedals for drum machines, what initially appears to be a kitschy sell out is revealed as something&amp;hellip; deeper.</description>
