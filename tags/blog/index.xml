      <description>first prototype!
  Using the Pomodoro Technique to make a Pomodoro Timer (Part 1) A famous Henry Ford quote goes: &amp;ldquo;Nothing is particularly hard, if you divide it into small [enough] jobs&amp;rdquo;. One popular way to practically implement this advice is something called the &amp;ldquo;Pomodoro Technique&amp;rdquo;. 1
The Pomodoro Technique aims to divide the day into bite-sized, productive time chunks. The idea is to set some kind of timer for 25 minutes before you start working.</description>

      <description>All-star Brutalist Skyline at Texas A&amp;amp;M
  If you went to college in the US, chances are you&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few depressing buildings like these. Often called &amp;ldquo;Brutalist&amp;rdquo; architecture, maybe you also heard rumors that they were built by the Russians or designed to suppress student riots. I&amp;rsquo;ll take a crack at separating fact from fiction today, as I process what made this style so popular, and why public colleges (of all tenants) seemed to fall in love.</description>

  As an engineer, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to visit Japan and not be obsessed with its trains. From record-breaking bullet trains to spaghetti-like subway networks, Japan does trains better than anywhere else I&amp;rsquo;ve been. But even the most train-obsessed nations acknowledge that heavy rail isn&amp;rsquo;t a catch-all solution. So as a bit of a curveball, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this transit post about everything but the trains in Japan.</description>

      <description>When Steve Jobs first announced the iPhone in 2007, the reception was far from glowing. Compared to cell phones of the time, the iPhone made a lot of confusing design decisions. Keyboard loyalists decried the lack of physical buttons, and the extra features like email or internet were seen as wasteful or pointless. Who would really want to carry a computer in their pocket?
I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone is asking this in 2025.</description>

      <title>üöÉ Rating Every Train in San Francisco</title>

      <description>As some may know, I moved to Santa Clara about a year ago. But if a non-Californian asks me where I live, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to skip the geography lesson and just say San Francisco. Despite how often I use this line, I recently realized I haven&amp;rsquo;t really explored San Francisco yet.
Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve driven in for a few concerts - but that&amp;rsquo;s not exploring. Driving is all point-to-point. Pull up to the destination and park in the least sketchy lot you can find.</description>

      <title>üèôÔ∏è Is Nagoya Boring?</title>

      <description>Recently, it seems like everyone I talk to is either visiting or returning from Japan. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just my observation - according to multiple sources, Japan&amp;rsquo;s post-covid tourism numbers are through the roof. While many plan their trips around the glitz and glamor of Tokyo or the rich culture of Kyoto, there&amp;rsquo;s another city that I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to see on any itinerary - Nagoya.
Despite being it&amp;rsquo;s third largest metro area, Nagoya is nationally renowned as &amp;ldquo;Japan&amp;rsquo;s most boring city&amp;rdquo;.</description>
