  If your formative years were later than 1990, your first thought was likely &amp;ldquo;Mario Kart&amp;rdquo;. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be alone - more and more people seem to be finding (and even writing!) music they can only describe as &amp;ldquo;Mario Kart Music&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>We are absolutely dead serious about music-making, and that‚Äôs what we want people to understand, that there‚Äôs no joke in it. We‚Äôre not intentionally trying to f*ck with people, we‚Äôre actually making this music that we love and we want people to hear it.1 ~ Ben Goldwasser
 You may not be familiar with MGMT, but anyone who had a pulse in the late 2000&amp;rsquo;s has most likely heard their work.</description>
