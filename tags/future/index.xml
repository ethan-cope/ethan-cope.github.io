      <description>Two trains pulling into the Silver Line station at UTD
  Dallas Area Rapid Transit serves over 50 million people a year. And in five months, if even one of Dallas&#39; twelve suburbs vote to leave DART, we could lose it for good. At the same time, DART just linked these disgruntled suburbs with its newest rail line. Is the state-of-the-art Silver Line enough to placate Plano and Co.</description>

  On the surface, Dallas looks like just another cookie-cutter commuter city.
